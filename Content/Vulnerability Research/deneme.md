## Hello Research

Welcome to my vulnerability research section! Here, I document my findings, methodologies, and insights from exploring various security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

### Research Methodology

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Identifying target systems and applications
   - Collecting technical documentation
   - Understanding the technology stack

2. **Analysis**
   - Code review and static analysis
   - Dynamic testing and behavior monitoring
   - Network traffic analysis

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Identifying potential security weaknesses
   - Testing for common vulnerabilities
   - Documenting findings and impact

### Tools & Techniques

- Static Analysis Tools
- Dynamic Analysis Tools
- Network Sniffers
- Web Application Scanners
- Custom Scripts and Exploits

### Responsible Disclosure

All vulnerabilities discovered are handled according to responsible disclosure practices:

1. Notify affected vendors/organizations
2. Provide reasonable time for patches
3. Public disclosure after fixes are available

Stay tuned for detailed write-ups of specific vulnerabilities and research findings!
