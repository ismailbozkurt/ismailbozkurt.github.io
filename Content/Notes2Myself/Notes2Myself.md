# Notes2Myself

This is a place where I write notes to myself.

> Be aware of the privileges you have! Appreciate the value of what you own!

> Don't waste time looking for a problem; try to see the problem.

> If I have an hour to solve a problem, I spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. - Albert Einstein

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. - Albert Einstein
